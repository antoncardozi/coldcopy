**First Comment (from maker):**
> Hey Product Hunt! 👋
>
> I'm Anton from Allied Advantage, and I built ColdCopy because I was tired of guessing whether my cold emails were any good.
>
> The truth is, most cold emails suck. The average reply rate is 1-5%, and most people have no idea why. They blast out hundreds of emails and hope for the best.
>
> ColdCopy is the feedback loop that's been missing. Paste your email, get a score out of 100, and get brutally specific tips to fix it. No AI fluff — real scoring based on research-backed best practices.
>
> A few things I'm proud of:
> - **The scoring algorithm is genuinely useful.** It checks Flesch-Kincaid reading level, you/I ratio, spam trigger words, CTA friction, personalization tokens, and more. It's not a gimmick.
> - **30+ real templates.** Every template is written to be actually usable — not generic filler. Each includes follow-ups and pro tips.
> - **100% private.** Everything runs client-side. Your emails never leave your browser.
> - **Zero dependencies.** One HTML file. Loads instantly. No signup required.
>
> I'd love your feedback — what would make this more useful for you? What scoring criteria am I missing?
>
> And if you try the scorer, share your score! I'm curious what the average PH user scores. 😄

### Twitter/X Launch Thread

**Tweet 1:**
> I built a cold email scoring tool last night.
>
> It's free. It scores your email out of 100. It's brutally honest.
>
> My first email scored 34. 😬
>
> Here's the thread on why I built it and what I learned about cold email: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
> Cold email has a 1-5% average reply rate.
>
> That means 95-99% of sales emails get ignored.
>
> The problem isn't cold email itself — it's that most people have zero feedback loop. They guess, blast, and hope.
>
> ColdCopy is the feedback loop.

**Tweet 3:**
> Here's what it actually scores:
>
> 📧 Subject line: length, personalization, spam triggers
> 👋 Opening line: is it about YOU or THEM?
> 📝 Body: reading level, word count, you/I ratio
> 🎯 CTA: friction level, question format
> ✅ Deliverability: spam words, links, formatting
> ⭐ Bonus: power words, brevity, tone

**Tweet 4:**
> The biggest insight from building this:
>
> Most cold emails fail for ONE reason — they're about the sender, not the recipient.
>
> The you/I ratio is the single most predictive metric. If you say "I" more than "you," your email is probably getting deleted.

**Tweet 5:**
> Also included: 30+ proven cold email templates by industry.
>
> SaaS, real estate, recruiting, e-commerce, consulting, financial services, and more.
>
> Each template includes:
> - Subject line
> - Full body
> - 2 follow-ups
> - Pro tips
>
> All free. No signup.

**Tweet 6:**
> Technical flex: the entire app is ONE HTML file.
>
> No React. No Tailwind. No API calls. No dependencies.
>
> 95KB. Loads instantly. Everything runs in your browser. Your emails never leave your machine.
>
> Sometimes the best tech stack is no tech stack.

**Tweet 7:**
> Try it: https://coldcopy.dev
>
> Share your score in the replies. I want to know the average.
>
> And if you think the scoring is wrong, tell me why. I'll update the algorithm.
>
> Built by @alliedadvantage. Free forever. 🔥

## Growth Loops

### Loop 1: Score Sharing
User scores email → sees shareable result → tweets/shares → new user scores their email → repeat.

**Optimization:**
- Make the share button prominent and pre-written
- Include ColdCopy URL in the share text
- OG image shows the score dynamically (future feature)
- "My email went from 34 → 87" before/after story format

### Loop 2: Template Submissions
User finds value in templates → wants to submit their own → contributes → more templates → more SEO value → more users.

**Implementation (Phase 2):**
- "Submit a template" form
- Community voting on templates
- Credit the author with a link (incentivizes sharing)
- Best templates get promoted to "Community Picks"

### Loop 3: Email Footer Badge
"Scored by ColdCopy" or "✓ ColdCopy Approved" badge for emails scoring 80+.

**Implementation:**
- Auto-generate a small text badge after high scores
- Users add it to their email signature
- Every recipient sees the brand → curiosity → visit ColdCopy

### Loop 4: Sales Team Adoption
One sales rep finds ColdCopy → shares with team → team adopts as standard → team leader buys Pro for team features.

**Implementation (Phase 2):**
- Team dashboard (Pro feature)
- Average team score tracking
- Template library sharing within teams
- Manager view of scoring trends

### Loop 5: SEO Compound
Blog posts target long-tail keywords → earn backlinks → domain authority increases → templates rank higher → more organic traffic → more users → more content.
